## Time Based
### Daily
* Check emails, slack, and slack reminders, create any required todo's (I use the "Things" app with a shortcut to quickly add todos)
* Run through "Things" inbox and schedule time for items to be done (could be a specific time, or just a date)
* Jump into Dependabot PRs and handle any that can be done with relative ease, assess the others for time sensitivity, create todos if needed
* Handle any unreviewed PRs
* Take a look at Trello to plan what item I will be working on next in preparation for standup
* Standup
* Begin working on ticketed work or todo's depending on priority (if I need help with priority, I get it at standup or via slack)
* Break for lunch
* When returning from lunch, check for and tackle any open support, bug, or  change requests.
* Back to main focus for the day
* If there is time left, decide on next ticket or todo, issue etc.
### Weekly
* Tackle (or plan when to tackle) open retro items
* Review open sentry issues
* Review Data Dog 

### Monthly
* Re-read / Review guides and documentation
* Check-in on personal rituals and adjust as needed

## Pattern Based
* Code Reviews
	* Review open PRs in the morning
	* Review open PRs when adding my own to the engineering room (take a penny leave a penny)
	* Pause what I'm working on if possible when a missed or urgent PR is bumped
* Channels (Support, bugs, etc.):
	*  Skim room notification's as they come in and leverage slack reminders if attention isn't needed immediately
	*  Surface to someone with more context if I'm unable to address it in the moment
