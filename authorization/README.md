## Permission Changes

- Keep permissions in the [DevOps] repository up to date.
- Ensure permission changes are documented in Trello. The transparency helps
  other departments know when and how permissions are changing.
  - Example documentation in Trello: [Allow Phys. Subs to end deferrals]
- Prefer having another engineer verify the permission change, [[Four Eyes Principle]]
