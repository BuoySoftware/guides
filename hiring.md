# Hiring

## Tracking

We track candidates in [Trello](https://trello.com/b/4VEsP1AM/engineering-hiring).

## Technical Interview

### Rails

* If I only wanted an array of fields from a model, how could I query for that?

  Try to understand how familiar they are with ActiveRecord. Would they query
  and use `map`? Or would they use something like `pluck`?

### React

* Can you explain the difference between a class based React Component and a
  Functional component?

  The goal here is to get an idea of the candidates familiarity of the basic
  difference of a class based component and a functional component. If they
  mention state, try to lead the conversation towards hooks like `useState`.
