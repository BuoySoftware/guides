# Working Together

A guide for working well together.

## Pair Programming

**Before:**

- Agree Scope (Pairing for two hours? Until the ticket is complete? Just get
  past the bug?)
- Agree Pairing Style (Time-based? Ping pong?)

**During:**

- Keep the chat going (Think aloud. Encourage/support)
- Keep switching (Follow the pairing style)
- Keep both involved ("Could we do this another way?")
- Keep breaking
- Keep checking in ("Could we search for a guide separately?")

**After:**

- Ask for Feedback (What did we do well? What could we have done better? Itâ€™ll
  feel weird, do it anyway)

## Meeting Guidelines

We've compiled some guidelines from various sources to help people feel included
and respected during meetings. You can read them in [notion](https://www.notion.so/Working-Together-58d975c707d8435db611d7f2f28165e9).
