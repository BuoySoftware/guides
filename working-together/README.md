# Working Together

A guide for working well together.

## Pair Programming

**Before:**

- Agree Scope (Pairing for two hours? Until the ticket is complete? Just get
  past the bug?)
- Agree Pairing Style (Time-based? Ping pong?)

**During:**

- Keep the chat going (Think aloud. Encourage/support)
- Keep switching (Follow the pairing style)
- Keep both involved ("Could we do this another way?")
- Keep breaking
- Keep checking in ("Could we search for a guide separately?")

**After:**

- Ask for Feedback (What did we do well? What could we have done better? Itâ€™ll
  feel weird, do it anyway)

## Meeting Guidelines

We've compiled some guidelines from various sources to help people feel included
and respected during meetings. You can read them in [notion](https://www.notion.so/Working-Together-58d975c707d8435db611d7f2f28165e9).

## Changes to Engineering Standards & Processes

When proposing a change, we utilize an escalation strategy.

1. #Engineering Slack Poll: Super small easy to reverse suggestions/changes (e.g. turning on the button in Github to show your branch is out of date)
2. PR: Small-medium change that is low impact and easy to reverse (e.g. turning on QOL Rubocop rule like SplitStrings)
3. [Notion doc](https://www.notion.so/Engineering-Proposals-1bc3d71a923380deb1e7e7f5befd903b?pvs=4): Medium to high impact changes, changes that are a little harder to reverse, or contentious changes (e.g. changing the line length Rubocop rule)
4. Notion doc(s) + working group: High impact changes that are more difficult to reverse and need consensus building and leadership buy-in (e.g. packwerk strategy, introducing new technology)
