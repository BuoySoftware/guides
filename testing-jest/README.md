# Testing with Jest

- Use [eslint-plugin-jest] to enforce testing style
- Use [@testing-library/jest-dom] for supplemental expectation matchers
- Use [React Testing Library] for testing [React](/react/) components
- Use [React Hooks Testing Library] for testing [React Hooks]
- Use [User Event] for simulating DOM events on React components under test
- Use [Fishery] for building factories
- Prefer writing specific unit tests over [Snapshot Testing]
- Prefer `describe` and `it` blocks over `test` blocks
