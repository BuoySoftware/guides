# Terminology

The language we use has power. Being as concise and descriptive as possible
helps to lessen ambiguity. This leads to shared understanding and better
outcomes.

## Terms

* Use `blocklist`, and not `blacklist`.
* Use `allowlist`, and not `whitelist`.
* Avoid using `master` and `slave`. 
  * For git, use `main`.
  * For databases, use `write database` and `read replica`.
  * For other scenarios, use terms such as `parent` and `child` or `leader` and
    `follower`. Be mindful of scenarios where other commands will create
language like, sending `kill` signals to `children`.
