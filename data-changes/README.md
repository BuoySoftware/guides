# Data Changes

- Prefer documenting data changes in Trello. The transparency helps other
  departments know data is being manipulated.
  - Example documentation in Trello: [Machine Setup Modeling]
- When in doubt, attach CSVs or screenshots from data clips generated from
  before the migration and after it was complete to the ticket.
  - Example data clips used to generate CSVs:
    - [Alarm Events Data Clip]
    - [Soft Goods Data Clip]
- Prefer having another engineer verify the data change, [[Four Eyes Principle]]
